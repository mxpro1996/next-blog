# Hugo Theme Stack 

This is a quick start template for [Hugo theme Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). It uses [Hugo modules](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) feature to load the theme.

It comes with a basic theme structure and configuration. GitHub action has been set up to deploy the theme to a public GitHub page automatically. Also, there's a cron job to update the theme automatically everyday.


In case you don't want to use GitHub codespace, you can also run this template in your local machine. **You need to install Git, Go and Hugo extended locally.** For more information, check official Hugo documentation: https://gohugo.io/installation/

## Update theme manually

Run:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v4
hugo mod tidy
```

> This starter template has been configured with `v4` version of theme. Due to the limitation of Go module, once the `v4` or up version of theme is released, you need to update the theme manually. (Modifying `config/module.toml` file)

## Deploy to another static page hostings

Check official Hugo documentation: https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/
